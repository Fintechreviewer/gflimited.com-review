        <h1>gflimited.com Review: Global Finance Asset Management Limited Exposed as a Scam 🚨</h1>
        <p class="rating">Rating: ⭐☆☆☆☆ (1 out of 5 stars)</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">gflimited.com</span>, also known as <span class="highlight">Global Finance Asset Management Limited</span>, is a recently launched broker that has raised numerous red flags. This review will expose why this broker is a scam and why you should avoid it at all costs.</p>

        <h2>Is gflimited.com Legit? 🕵️‍♂️</h2>
        <p>No, <span class="highlight">gflimited.com</span> is not legit. Here are the key reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🚩 The website was created in <span class="highlight">October 2024</span>, but they claim to have a financial activities license from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) dating back to 2022. This timeline discrepancy is highly suspicious.</li>
            <li>🚩 The provided Hong Kong address is <span class="highlight">fake and cannot be verified</span>.</li>
            <li>🚩 The broker claims to only serve <span class="highlight">professional investors</span>, but their account types (starting at €250) clearly target <span class="highlight">retail investors</span>, which is illegal under their license.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is Global Finance Asset Management Limited a Scam? 🚫</h2>
        <p>Here’s why <span class="highlight">gflimited.com</span> is a scam:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>💸 The account types are designed to <span class="highlight">lure investors into depositing more money</span>, increasing the risk of significant losses.</li>

            <li>📉 There are <span class="highlight">no genuine customer reviews</span> for this broker. All positive reviews online are likely <span class="highlight">sponsored or fake</span>.</li>
